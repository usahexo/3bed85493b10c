The Timberwolves are a team on the rise in the NBA.

This is also a very exciting time for bettors looking to put money down on the Timberwolves.

At sportsbooks like Bovada, the Timberwolves have betting odds of +1400 to win the NBA championship in 2018. This puts them behind teams like the Golden State Warriors (+500), Boston Celtics (+650) and Houston Rockets (+850), but ahead of teams like the Oklahoma City Thunder (+1800) and Cleveland Cavaliers (+2000).
