#  Who owns the sprawling casino Keno game?

The casino Keno game, a popular pastime enjoyed in many jurisdictions around the world, is typically seen as a leisure pursuit. But who actually owns this game, and profits from it?

Keno is believed to have originated in China in 200 BC, and was brought to Europe by Marco Polo. The modern version of the game as played in casinos is largely credited to Chinese American entrepreneur Joseph San Fai. In the early 1970s, San Fai opened the first legal keno parlor in the United States in Las Vegas.

Today, keno is estimated to be a $30 billion industry worldwide, with revenues split between operators and players. The operators make their money from the house edge built into the game, while players can enjoy potential payouts of up to $1 million depending on the size of the bet.

So who owns keno? The answer is not straightforward, as there are a number of entities involved in different parts of the world. Typically, keno games are owned by casino operators, but there are some exceptions. In China for example, where keno originated, the government operates all lotteries including keno.

Overall, it can be said that keno is a highly lucrative game that generates billions of dollars in revenue each year. Operators and players alike can enjoy its excitement and potential for big wins, but it’s important to remember that the house always has an edge!

How to Play Casino Keno

 So you want to learn how to play casino keno? It's not difficult at all! Here's a quick overview of the rules: 
You'll be given a card with 80 numbers on it. 20 of these numbers will be drawn at random. Your goal is to match as many of these numbers as possible with those that are randomly chosen. 
Prizes are awarded based on how many numbers you match. The more numbers you match, the bigger your prize will be! 
It's important to note that you can't choose which numbers you want to match – they're all chosen randomly. So just relax and have fun with the process! 
Now that you know how to play, let's take a look at some tips for increasing your chances of winning: 

- Choose games with smaller jackpots if you're just starting out. These games offer better odds and are easier to win than games with larger jackpots.- Play games that are compatible with your bankroll size. If you only have $50 to spend, don't waste it on games that require a $5 bet.- Stick to betting the same amount each time. This will help you avoid losing all your money in one go.- Use bonus offers strategically. If you're given free spins or bonus credits, use them on games that have good odds.- Remember that no strategy is guaranteed to work 100% of the time – so don't get too frustrated if you don't win every game!
