- Developing an efficient transport network, including roads, railways, airports, and seaports.

- Strengthening the agricultural sector, through improved irrigation systems and support for small-scale farmers.

- Encouraging private investment and entrepreneurship through measures such as simplified business registration procedures and tax breaks.

The Simenon 2022 plan is expected to cost approximately $15 billion USD, which will be funded through a combination of public and private sources. The government of Rwanda is committed to achieving these goals and is working closely with donor countries and international organizations to make sure that all necessary resources are available.
