# Poker fans rejoice as Unibet releases new RTA

Online poker players now have a new tool to help them hone their skills – the Unibet RTA.

The Unibet RTA, or real-time average, is a graph that displays the player’s moving average over the last 500 hands played. The aim is to help players see how they are performing on different tables and in different situations.

“The Unibet RTA is an extremely useful tool for all levels of poker player, from beginner to professional,” said Severin Rasset, Head of Poker at Unibet. “It provides valuable insights into a player’s game by displaying data such as average pot size, number of hands played and win rate. Players can use this information to adjust their game and improve their overall results.”

To use the Unibet RTA, players simply need to log in to their account and click on the ‘Stats & Analysis’ tab. They can then select the ‘RTA (Real-time Average)’ option from the menu and view their graph.

Unibet's new poker RTA: Game changer or dud?
The launch of Poker's new Real-Time Action (RTA) has been hotly debated in the poker community. Some believe it is a game changer that will increase the appeal of the game to a wider audience, while others are convinced it is simply a dud that will do nothing to improve the current state of poker. Let's take a closer look at both sides of the argument.

On the pro-RTA side, it is argued that the new format will make poker more exciting and engaging for players. In traditional poker, there is a lot of waiting around as players wait for their turn to act. This can often lead to boredom and disengagement from the game. With RTA, players will be constantly involved in the action, making it more exciting and dynamic.

Another advantage of RTA is that it is seen as a more skillful format than traditional poker. In RTA, players are not limited to playing only one hand at a time; they can make decisions on multiple hands simultaneously. This makes for a more complex and strategic game, which is more appealing to skilled players.

On the con-RTA side, some people argue that the new format will actually make poker less enjoyable for players. One concern is that with so much action going on, it will be difficult to keep track of what is happening in the game. Another concern is that inexperienced players could quickly lose money in this fast-paced format.

Ultimately, whether or not Unibet's new Poker RTA is successful remains to be seen. Those who are pro-RTA argue that it has the potential to breathe new life into the game and attract new players, while those who are con-RTA argue that it could do more harm than good. Only time will tell which side is correct!
