#  How to Draw Bluey in addition to Bingo

Bingo and Bluey are two of the most favored Australian cartoon characters. While Bingo is a small, excitable dog with a love of food, Bluey is a big, friendly kangaroo who loves nothing more than spending time with his mates.

Here's how to draw Bluey:

1. Start by drawing a basic oval for the body.

2. Next, draw in the legs and tail. The legs should be thin and elongated, while the tail should be fluffy and curved.

3. Draw in the head and face using simple shapes. For the head, start with an oval shape and then add in the features like the eyes, nose, and mouth.

4. Finally, add some shading to give your illustration depth and realism.

#  Professional Tips For Drawing Bluey

Bluey is a wonderful companion animal and is known to be one of the most friendly and intelligent breeds of dog. As with any breed, there are some important things to bear in mind when caring for and training a Bluey. The following professional tips will help you ensure that your Bluey thrives both physically and mentally.

1. Provide plenty of exercise

Blueys need plenty of exercise to stay healthy and happy. A good daily walk or play session in the yard is essential. If your Bluey isn't getting enough exercise, he may become restless and destructive.

2. Feed a balanced diet

It's important to feed your Bluey a balanced diet to ensure he stays healthy. Adult dogs should be fed two meals per day, with a mix of wet and dry food. Puppies should be fed three times per day until they reach about six months old, when they can move to two meals per day. Avoid feeding your dog table scraps, as this can lead to weight gain and health problems.

3. House train your dog

Blueys are typically easy to house train, but it's important to start training them early. Start by teaching your dog to go outside on cue. When he goes potty outside, praise him enthusiastically and give him a treat. If he has an accident indoors, immediately say "no" in a firm voice and take him outside to finish going potty. Never hit or punish your dog for making mistakes - this will only make him afraid of you and less likely to listen to you in the future.

4. Socialize your dog

It's important for Blueys to socialize with other dogs when they're young so that they learn how to interact appropriately with their canine counterparts. Socialization should also include exposure to new people, places, sounds, and experiences. This will help ensure that your Bluey is well-adjusted and confident in any situation he may encounter later in life.

5. obedience train your dog

Obedience training is an essential part of training any dog - especially one as smart as a Bluey! Start obedience training early (ideally when your puppy is around eight weeks old) and continue through adulthood for the best results. Basic commands such as sit, stay, come, heel, and down are essential for keeping your Bluey under control when out in public or around other animals.

#  How To Draw Bluey Better Than Ever

Bluey is a wonderful dog who just wants to be loved and to please his family. In this article, we're going to teach you how to make Bluey's coat look spectacular and keep him healthy and happy.

First, start by brushing Bluey's hair daily. This will help remove any mats or tangles, as well as distribute the dog's natural oils throughout the coat. It will also help keep the coat looking shiny and healthy.

Next, you'll want to give Bluey a good bath. Be sure to use a dog-specific shampoo that will be gentle on his skin and coat. Rinse him thoroughly afterwards to get rid of all the soap suds.

Once he's bathed and dried off, it's time to start styling Bluey's hair! You can use a brush or comb to do this, but we recommend using your fingers instead. Start at the base of his neck and work your way down, then flip him over and do the same thing on his back. This is a great way to make sure his hair is evenly distributed and looks its best.

If you need to trim Bluey's hair, be sure to do so evenly all over his body. Avoid cutting too close to the skin, as this can cause irritation.

Finally, finish up by applying a quality dog coat conditioner. This will help keep Bluey's hair looking healthy and vibrant for weeks or even months!
