#  Betfair Joel Coen Adds Basketball Betting

When people think about sports betting, the first thing that comes to mind is usually horse racing and football. However, Joel Coen, Director of Betfair, believes that basketball can be a viable option for those looking to make some money off of their bets.

There are a few reasons why basketball betting might be a good idea. First, the sport is extremely popular in the United States. Americans account for more than half of all basketball fans around the world. This means that there is a large potential audience for bettors to target.

Second, while basketball is not as popular as football or horse racing when it comes to betting, there is still plenty of action to be had. In fact, during the 2017-2018 season, basketball accounted for $1.8 billion in total wagers in the United States. This means that there is significant potential for profit if you can correctly predict the outcomes of games.

Finally, the odds for betting on basketball games are typically very good. This is because most bettors do not understand the sport very well and are not willing to risk their money on uncertain outcomes. This leaves plenty of value in bets placed on games between two evenly matched teams.

If you are interested in betting on basketball games, there are a few things that you need to keep in mind. First, it is important to do your research and understand which teams are playing well and which teams are struggling. Second, you need to make sure that you are placing your bets at the right time. Bettors who wait until just before a game starts tend to get better odds than those who place their bets earlier on in the process. Finally, it is important to always have a Plan B in case your original bet does not go your way. There is no guarantee that you will win every bet that you place, so it is important to be prepared for when things do not go according to plan.

Basketball betting can be a great way to make some extra money while watching your favorite sport unfold before your eyes. By understanding the sport and by making smart bets, you can increase your chances of winning while enjoying one of America’s most popular sports

#  March Madness Heats Up At Betfair Joel Coen

The NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Tournament is one of the most highly anticipated sporting events in the United States. 64 college basketball teams compete in a single-elimination tournament to determine the national champion. The games are played between mid-March and early April, with the final game – usually known as “the Final Four” – taking place in late March or early April.

This year’s tournament is shaping up to be one of the most exciting ever. Villanova, the defending national champion, is one of the top contenders, along with Duke, Kentucky, and Kansas. Other teams that could make a deep run include Gonzaga, North Carolina, Michigan State, and Virginia.

One of the great things about the tournament is that it’s so unpredictable. Any team can beat any other team on any given day. That’s what makes betting on the games so much fun. And at Betfair, you can bet on all of the action live as it unfolds.

If you’re looking to get in on some March Madness action, here are a few tips to help you win big:

1) familiarize yourself with the odds: Before placing any bets, it’s important to understand how the odds work. In most cases, favorites will have shorter odds than underdogs. This means that a $100 bet on a favorite would pay out less than a $100 bet on an underdog. However, underdogs often offer more favorable odds for those who are willing to risk more money. So if you think an underdog is going to pull off an upset, it may be worth risking a bigger bet.

2) take advantage of bonuses and promotions: Many online sportsbooks offer special bonuses and promotions during major sporting events like March Madness. So be sure to check out what offerings are available at Betfair before making your bets. You may be able to score some extra free cash just by placing a few wagers on the games.

3) follow the trends: In any sport, there are always certain teams and players that tend to do well in certain situations. Keep track of which teams are playing well heading into the tournament, and which players are hot right now. This information can give you an edge when making your bets.

#  NFL Continues To Be Popular At Betfair Joel Coen

A few months ago, NFL appeared to be in a bit of a crisis. After week 7, ratings were down across the board.
