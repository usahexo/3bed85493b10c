#  Which Tribe Owns Atmore Casino?

The Poarch Band of Creek Indians own and operate the Atmore casino, just northeast of Mobile, Alabama. The casino is a popular destination for gambling and entertainment in the region. The Poarch Band of Creek Indians are federally recognized as an Indian tribe, and they own and operate three other casinos in Alabama as well.

The Atmore casino is a relatively small facility, with just over 100,000 square feet of gaming space. It offers more than 1,000 slot machines, as well as table games including blackjack, roulette, and craps. The casino also has a poker room and a race and sports book.

The Atmore casino is open every day from 8am to 2am. In addition to the casino floor, there is a hotel on site with 102 rooms. There are also several restaurants and bars at the casino, as well as a gift shop.

The Poarch Band of Creek Indians are one of the few tribes in the United States that owns and operates their own casino. Many tribes lease their casinos to private companies, but the Poarch Band of Creek Indians have decided to keep control of their operations themselves. This has been beneficial for the tribe, as they have been able to make profits from their casinos while still providing jobs and economic development for their members.
