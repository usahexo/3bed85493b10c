#  Guinea Struggles to Curb Spread of Deadly Ebola Virus 

In the last few weeks, Guinea has been struggling to contain the Ebola virus which has killed more than 100 people in the West African country. The outbreak of the deadly virus has caused panic among residents and health workers alike.

The Ebola virus is a highly contagious disease that can be spread through contact with infected blood or other bodily fluids. Symptoms include fever, vomiting, diarrhea and internal and external bleeding. There is no cure or specific treatment for the virus, which is often fatal.

Guinea's health ministry has announced a number of measures to try to curb the spread of the virus, including stepped up surveillance at border crossings and increased efforts to educate residents about how to protect themselves from the disease. The government has also imposed a ban on all public gatherings in an effort to prevent people from congregating in large groups where the virus could easily spread.

So far, these measures have been largely unsuccessful in stopping the spread of the disease. In recent days, cases of Ebola have been reported in both Liberia and Sierra Leone, neighboring countries already struggling with high levels of poverty and poor health infrastructure.

The scale of this latest Ebola outbreak is worrying health officials worldwide. To date, there have been more than 1,500 cases of Ebola reported in Africa, with over 700 deaths. If this epidemic continues to spread, it could become one of the deadliest outbreaks in history.

#  What is Baltic Black Jack and Why is it Prevalent in Guinea? 

Baltic Black Jack, also known as 21, is a variation of the classic card game blackjack. The game is popular in many parts of the world, including Guinea. Let's take a closer look at what makes Baltic Black Jack so intriguing.

The objective of Baltic Black Jack is to draw cards totaling 21 or as close to 21 as possible without going over. The player must first decide how many hands they want to play. Typically, 3 or 4 hands are played. Each hand consists of 1 or 2 cards. The player can either hit (draw another card) or stand (end the turn). If the player's hand total is over 21, they bust and lose the hand. The dealer must also reach a hand total of 21 without going over in order to win; otherwise, the player wins the hand.

Some key rules that apply specifically to Baltic Black Jack are as follows:

- A player cannot split a hand that contains only 1 card.
- A player cannot double down on a hand that contains only 1 card.
- A player cannot re-split cards if they have already split them.
- If the player splits a pair, they receive only 1 additional card for each card played thereafter. 
- The dealer must hit on 16 and stand on 17.

So why is Baltic Black Jack so popular in Guinea? There are likely several reasons. Firstly, the game is relatively simple to learn and can be enjoyed by players of all ages and experience levels. Secondly, there is a fair amount of strategy involved in playing Baltic Black Jack correctly, which can make for an exciting and challenging experience. Finally, the potential payout odds are relatively good compared to other casino games, making it a potentially profitable option for players who are willing to take some risks.

#  The Rich Culture and History of Guinea 

The Republic of Guinea is a country located in West Africa. It has a population of over 12 million and is estimated to be one of the poorest countries in the world. Despite its poverty, Guinea is rich in culture and history. 

The first people to live in Guinea were the Susu and Peulh, who are believed to have migrated from nearby countries such as Senegal and Mali. The Susu are noted for their intricate jewelry-making skills, and the Peulh are known for their musicianship. 

Guinea was colonized by France in 1890, and remained under French rule until independence was gained in 1958. Since then, Guinea has been ruled by a series of dictatorships. The current president, Alpha Condé, was elected in 2010. 

Guinea is a diverse country with more than 60 different ethnic groups. Each group has its own unique culture and traditions. Some of the most notable groups include the Fulas, who are noted for their transhumance lifestyle; the Mandingos, who are known for their traditional music and dance; and the Malinkes, who are well-known for their fabric-making skills. 

Despite its poverty, Guinea is a beautiful country with a rich culture and history. Its people are warm and welcoming, and its festivals are always lively and enjoyable. I hope to visit Guinea one day and experience its wonderful culture firsthand!

#  A Look at the Health Situation in Guinea 

The Republic of Guinea is a country located in West Africa. It has a population of approximately 12.5 million people and is ranked as the world’s 24th most populous country. The country is divided into ten administrative regions, each headed by a prefect. The capital city is Conakry. 

Guinea has a tropical climate with relatively high humidity year-round. The average annual rainfall is about 1,200 mm (47.2 in), most of which falls during the rainy season from June to September. 

The health sector in Guinea has made significant progress over the past few years, thanks to support from bilateral and multilateral development partners. However, more work is needed to improve the quality and accessibility of healthcare services for all citizens, especially in rural areas. 

This report provides an overview of the health situation in Guinea, highlighting key issues and challenges facing the sector. It is based on data from the World Health Organization (WHO) and other sources. 

Morbidity and Mortality 

Guinea suffers from high levels of both morbidity and mortality. In 2016, the crude death rate was 9 deaths per 1,000 population, while the under-five mortality rate was 170 deaths per 1,000 live births [1]. 

Some of the main causes of death in Guinea include malaria, pneumonia, diarrheal diseases and neonatal conditions [1]. Malaria is a major public health problem in Guinea, accounting for approximately 30% of all admissions to hospitals and clinics [2]. Pneumonia is also a leading cause of death, particularly among children under five years old [3]. 

The maternal mortality ratio in Guinea is also high, with 890 deaths per 100,000 live births [4]. This is largely due to lack of access to quality healthcare services, including skilled birth attendance and emergency obstetric care [4]. An estimated 60% of pregnant women do not receive adequate prenatal care [5]. 

Health Infrastructure 

Despite significant progress over the past few years, Guinea still faces major infrastructure challenges in the health sector. There are only about 12 doctors and 190 nurses per 100,000 population nationwide [6], while 63% of all villages have no access to basic healthcare services [7]. Moreover, less than 50% of health facilities are equipped with electricity or running water [8]. 

The government has made strides in expanding access to healthcare services over the past few years. In 2017 alone, some 2 million people were added to the national health insurance scheme – which now covers nearly 70% of the population [9]. However, further investments are needed to improve infrastructure and expand access to healthcare services for all citizens – especially those living in rural areas. 


Funding for Healthcare 

Guinea faces significant funding constraints when it comes to its health sector. In 2016, total expenditure on health was estimated at US$230 million or 3% of GDP [10]. This figure includes both public and private spending on health. Of this amount, 63% was financed by donors – primarily through development assistance programs [10]. 

This leaves a considerable financing gap that needs to be filled in order to provide adequate healthcare services for all citizens. The government estimates that an additional US$360 million per year is required to achieve universal healthcare coverage (UHC) by 2025 [11]. Additional investments will also be needed to improve infrastructure and expand access to healthcare services nationwide.

#  Challenges Facing Guinea's Economy

Guinea is a landlocked country located in West Africa. It is the world's second-largest producer of bauxite after Australia and has rich deposits of diamonds and gold. Despite these natural resources, Guinea's economy has been struggling in recent years. This article will explore some of the challenges facing Guinea's economy and how they can be addressed.

One of the biggest challenges facing Guinea's economy is its high level of poverty. More than 60% of the population lives below the poverty line, making it one of the poorest countries in the world. This poverty is exacerbated by high levels of unemployment and inequality.

Another challenge facing Guinea's economy is its lack of infrastructure. Guinea does not have a reliable transport network, which makes it difficult to get goods to market. The country also has a limited electricity supply, which hampers industrial development.

Guinea also suffers from a lack of human capital. The country has a very low literacy rate and a shortage of skilled workers. This lack of human capital inhibits economic growth and prevents the country from taking advantage of its natural resources.

One way that Guinea could address these challenges is by seeking international assistance. The country could attract foreign investment by liberalizing its economy and improving its business environment. It could also receive aid from international organizations such as the World Bank and IMF.
