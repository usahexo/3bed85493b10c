#  FBI blocks Perform US online casinos

The FBI has announced a crackdown on 16 online casinos that operate from within the United States. The agency says that the casinos are illegal, and has ordered them to immediately cease operations.

In a statement, FBI spokesperson Lindsay Tony said: "The FBI does not tolerate illegal gambling operations in the United States. These online casinos are operating without our permission, and we will take whatever steps are necessary to shut them down."

The casinos affected by the crackdown include some of the most popular sites in the country, including Casino.com, Slotocash.com, and MiamiClubCasino.com. All of these sites have been ordered to close their doors immediately.

The owners of the casinos affected by the crackdown say that they are stunned by the news. "We have been operating in full compliance with all US laws," one owner said. "We have never received any warnings or indication from the authorities that we were doing anything wrong."

Despite this assertion, it appears that the FBI has been investigating these casinos for some time. In fact, several of them have already been shut down in previous raids conducted by the agency.

So why is the FBI cracking down on online casinos now? One possible reason is that Congress is currently considering a bill that would legalize and regulate online gambling in the United States. If this bill is passed, it would render these specific casinos illegal. Therefore, it's possible that the FBI is trying to shut them down before they can become legalized and compete with more legitimate businesses.

#  Is your online casino being blocked by the FBI?

It's a question that has been on the minds of online casino players for years now – is their favorite site being blocked by the FBI? It's a valid concern, especially in light of recent news about the FBI shutting down several popular online casinos. But what does this mean for players who still want to enjoy their favorite casino games?

The first thing to understand is that not all online casinos are being blocked by the FBI. In fact, many of the most popular and well-respected sites are still operating without issue. So if your casino of choice is one of these, you don't need to worry – you can continue to enjoy your favorite games without any issues.

However, if you're playing at an online casino that has been shut down by the FBI, there are a few things you need to know. First of all, your funds may be at risk. The site may have closed down permanently, meaning you may never see your money again. Or, it may have been seized by the authorities and turned into restitution for victims of fraud or other crimes. So if you're playing at an online casino that's been shut down by the FBI, it's important to be aware of these risks and to proceed with caution.

In addition, it's important to note that playing at an unlicensed site can be risky. The site may not be regulated or licensed by a governing body, which means it may not be safe or secure. So if you're looking for a new place to play, it's always best to stick with reputable and licensed sites rather than taking a chance on an unlicensed operator.

So is your online casino being blocked by the FBI? If it's one of the big-name sites that are still up and running, then you don't need to worry – you can keep on playing without any issues. But if it's an unlicensed site that's been shut down by the authorities, then it's important to proceed with caution – your funds may be at risk.

#  Blocked online casinos

There are many online casinos that are blocked in specific countries. For example, online casinos that are blocked in the United States can be found at gamblingreports.com. This website provides a comprehensive list of all the online casinos that are not available to players in the United States.

The reasoning for the blockage of these online casinos varies from country to country. In the United States, for example, the blockage is typically due to legal reasons. Online casinos that operate within the United States without a license from the appropriate governing body can be considered illegal, and thus they are often blocked.

The same is true in other countries. In Germany, for example, several online casinos were blocked in early 2018 due to a new law that went into effect called the “Geldspielgesetz” (gaming law). This new law prohibits unlicensed operators from offering their services to German players. As a result, many popular online casinos were forced to block German players altogether.

So why would an online casino choose to block certain players? The answer is simple – it’s not worth it for them to offer their services to players in those specific countries. Operating outside of a country’s regulated market can be very risky, and it often ends up costing casinos a lot of money in legal fees and fines.

There are some cases, however, where blocking certain players is not really necessary. In some cases, it’s just easier for the casino operators to block certain countries altogether instead of trying to cater to each individual market. This is especially true for smaller operators who may not have the resources necessary to cover all of the different markets around the world.

If you’re looking for an online casino that accepts players from your country, then you should check out gamblingreports.com. This website provides a comprehensive list of all the online casinos that are available to players in your country, as well as information on which countries are blocked from playing at each casino.

#  How to unblock your online casino

There are a few methods you can use to unblock your online casino. The first is by using a VPN service. A VPN service allows you to connect to servers in different locations around the world. This will then give you access to websites that are blocked in your location. The second method is by using a proxy server. A proxy server works in a similar way to a VPN service, but it is not as secure. The third and final method is by changing your DNS server settings. This is the least effective method as it is not as secure as the other two methods.

If you are looking for a VPN service to unblock your online casino, we recommend ExpressVPN. ExpressVPN is one of the best VPN services on the market and it has been voted Best Overall VPN by PCMag.com. They offer a 30-day money-back guarantee, so you can try their service risk free.
