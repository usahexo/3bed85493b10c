<h1 id="Are-all-fairy-tales-based-on-fables"><a href="#Are-all-fairy-tales-based-on-fables" class="headerlink" title="Are all fairy tales based on fables?"></a>Are all fairy tales based on fables?</h1><p>Most fairy tales are based on fables, but not all fables are fairy tales. Fairy tales are story that feature folkloric creatures such as fairies, elves, goblins, and trolls. They are often magical, and the characters often go on adventures. Fables, on the other hand, are moral stories that teach a lesson.</p>
<h1 id="What-makes-a-story-a-fable"><a href="#What-makes-a-story-a-fable" class="headerlink" title="What makes a story a fable?"></a>What makes a story a fable?</h1><p>A fable, as defined by the Merriam-Webster dictionary, is “a short story that teaches a moral lesson.” But what specifically makes a story qualify as a fable? In my opinion, there are three specific elements that make a story a fable: the use of animals as characters, the use of symbols, and the use of exaggeration.</p>
<p>First and foremost, one of the key characteristics that separates fables from other types of stories is the use of animals as characters. While it is not necessary for every fable to include animals, this tends to be a common theme among fables. In fact, many times the characters in fables are not actually humans, but animals with human-like qualities. This serves as a way to help teach moral lessons in an easily digestible way. The stories can be interpreted on multiple levels, depending on the age and reading level of the audience.</p>
<p>Another distinguishing feature of fables is their use of symbols. In addition to using animals as characters, fables also often make use of symbols to get their point across. For example, in Aesop’s well-known fable “The Lion and The Mouse”, the lion can be seen as a symbol for strength and power, while the mouse can be seen as a symbol for humility and courage. This type of symbolism allows for even further interpretation and discussion of the story’s moral lesson.</p>
<p>Finally, one other aspect that helps set fables apart from other types of stories is their use of exaggeration. Fables typically employ hyperbole in order to get their point across in an easily understood way. For example, in “The Ant and The Grasshopper”, the grasshopper spends his summer days eating and playing instead of preparing for winter like the ant did. When winter comes, the grasshopper is left starving while the ant has plenty to eat. This exaggerated example makes it easy for children to understand why it is important to prepare for difficult times ahead.</p>
<p>So what makes a story a fable? In my opinion, it is the combination of animals as characters, symbols, and exaggeration that helps set these stories apart from others. While not all fables include all three elements, they are commonly found together and help make these stories an effective way to teach moral lessons.</p>
<h1 id="Who-decides-which-stories-are-classified-as-fables"><a href="#Who-decides-which-stories-are-classified-as-fables" class="headerlink" title="Who decides which stories are classified as fables?"></a>Who decides which stories are classified as fables?</h1><p>The classification of a story as a fable is often left up to the discretion of the author. While there are some general characteristics that are often associated with fables, such as having animals as characters, ultimately it is up to the author to decide what makes a story a fable and what does not. Some authors may choose to include fantastical elements in their stories in order to make them qualify as fables, while others may opt for more realistic stories that still have morals or teach a lesson.</p>
<p>There are, however, some general guidelines that many authors follow when classifying their stories as fables. One common characteristic is that fables often have a succinct and easy-to-remember moral message. In addition, the animals or other characters that appear in fables are often symbolic of certain qualities or traits, and they are often used to deliver the moral lesson of the story. Fables also typically feature simple storylines and dialogue, making them easy for children to understand.</p>
<h1 id="Why-are-fables-often-used-to-teach-moral-lessons"><a href="#Why-are-fables-often-used-to-teach-moral-lessons" class="headerlink" title="Why are fables often used to teach moral lessons?"></a>Why are fables often used to teach moral lessons?</h1><p>A fable is a short story that typically features animals or inanimate objects that talk and act like people. They are often used to teach moral lessons as a way of illustrating general truths. This is because they can easily communicate complex concepts in an understandable way, without being too preachy or heavy-handed.</p>
<p>Another reason why fables are often used to teach moral lessons is because they are usually quite short, which makes them easy to remember. This is especially important for children who are still learning about right and wrong. By telling them stories that feature unambiguous good and evil characters, parents can help to instill the basic principles of morality in their kids at an early age.</p>
<p>Finally, fables can be useful for teaching moral lessons because they often have a whimsical quality that makes them fun to read. This can make it more enjoyable for children to learn about important values like honesty, kindness, and perseverance.</p>
